# SWEET CHEEKS

## Description

Our skin is the largest organ in the body, protecting us from outside elements. Healthy skin can improve confidence, mood, and appearance. Many people who are interested in getting into skincare don’t know where to start. Each person’s skin varies in skin type- from oily to dry to combination skin. There’s also many other different factors to consider such as discoloration, scarring, rosacea, sensitive skin, etc. Many skin care lovers would love an app where finding the right product is simplified. Our app consists of a community of skincare lovers that post reviews of the best skincare products out there. Each member of our community has a detailed profile where other users can view and read about their skincare regimens. Targeting all skin types, we add value by simplifying the process of finding the right products after reviewing those with similar skin concerns and the products they used to solve their issues.
